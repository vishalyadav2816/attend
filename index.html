  <p>hello, it's me, Vishal.....I would like to tell you that you are so unique, but there is a little bit of a problem in you that you smile so little......your morning message puts the first smile on my face .... this day I do multiple activities like playing ludo, listening song, watching a movie, enjoy with family but while doing this all thing I miss you in every moment just thing when my phone is going to show me a notification of your message, just checking you last seen on Snapchat, and wait again when you are going to come again. ..... when you are not messaging I just visit to watch your photos and videos(i love the video in which you are singing i wanna be your)...
    
    
    
    
    To my love, you bring sunshine to my days and moonlight to my nights. You are the reason for my smile and the beat of my heart. I love you!</p>
